### In this project the we were trying to predict the death rate of the cancer patients.
 The variables with higher multi co-lenearity were dropped and the remaining were used in training of the model. the varables used were; 'incidenceRate', 'medIncome',
       'povertyPercent', 'studyPerCap', 'MedianAge', 'MedianAgeMale',
       'AvgHouseholdSize', 'PercentMarried', 'PctNoHS18_24', 'PctHS18_24', 'PctBachDeg18_24', 'PctHS25_Over',
       'PctBachDeg25_Over', 'PctUnemployed16_Over',
       'PctPublicCoverage', 'PctWhite', 'PctAsian', 'PctOtherRace',
       'BirthRate'. 
### the three algorithms trained were ,linear regression,decision tree,random forest and support vector machine which was later concluded that the best model for the problem was random forest because it has the least mean squared error.
